We will use the methylation table obtained from Bismark. The file represent the result of wgbs performed in _Arabidopsis thaliana_ sample.

The file is located at the following path:

`/data2/biotecnologie_molecolari_magris/epigenomics/meth_distribution/arabidopsis_wgbs.CX_report.txt`

The suffix of the file is `.CX_report.txt` as already seen in the previous lessons.
The structure is as follows:

![Figure 1: header of the CG data frame]({{ "/assets/images/3a3-0_methylation_distribution_arabidopsis.png" | relative_url }})
<br>

**Figure 1:** First rows of the *arabidopsis_wgbs.CX_report.txt* file.

The file is tab separated and the columns are in the following order:
1. **chromosome**
2. **coordinate**
3. **strand**
4. **number of reads with methylation for the C**
5. **number of reads without methylation**
6. **C-context**
7. **trinucleotide context**

We will use average values in windows in order to understand how we can represent methylation values across a chromosome as depicted in [Figure 2](#figure-2).

# Analysis of Methylation

In this analysis, we will refer to the methylation distribution shown in [Figure 1](#figure-1-methylation-distribution).

<!--
Now we will perform the analysis of the methylation distribution in the three contexts `CG`, `CHG` and `CHH` across a chromosome. 
-->
We will use two different approaches: 
- one using the `R` library
- one using the `bedtools` package
